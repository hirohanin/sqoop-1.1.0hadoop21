Sqoop Releases
--------------

Sqoop is an open source software product of Cloudera, Inc.

Software development for Sqoop occurs at http://github.com/cloudera/sqoop.
At that site you can obtain:

- New releases of Sqoop as well as its most recent source code
- An issue tracker
- A wiki that contains Sqoop documentation

Sqoop is compatible with Apache Hadoop 0.21 and Cloudera's
Distribution of Hadoop version 3.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following prerequisite knowledge is required for this product:

- Basic computer technology and terminology
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces such as +bash+
- Relational database management systems
- Basic familiarity with the purpose and operation of Hadoop

Before you can use Sqoop, a release of Hadoop must be installed and
configured. We recommend that you download Cloudera's Distribution
for Hadoop (CDH3) from the Cloudera Software Archive at
http://archive.cloudera.com for straightforward installation of Hadoop
on Linux systems.

This document assumes you are using a Linux or Linux-like environment.
If you are using Windows, you may be able to use cygwin to accomplish
most of the following tasks. If you are using Mac OS X, you should see
few (if any) compatibility errors. Sqoop is predominantly operated and
tested on Linux.
