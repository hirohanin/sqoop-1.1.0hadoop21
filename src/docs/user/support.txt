Getting Support

Some general information is available at the
http://wiki.github.com/cloudera/sqoop/[Sqoop wiki].

Report bugs in Sqoop to the issue tracker at
https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/SQOOP[].

Questions and discussion regarding the usage of Sqoop should be directed to the

Before contacting either forum, run your Sqoop job with the

possible. Also report the string returned by +sqoop version+ as
well as the version of Hadoop you are running (+hadoop version+).
