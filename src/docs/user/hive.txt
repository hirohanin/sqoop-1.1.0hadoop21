Importing Data Into Hive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sqoop's import tool's main function is to upload your data into files
in HDFS. If you have a Hive metastore associated with your HDFS
cluster, Sqoop can also import the data into Hive by generating and
executing a +CREATE TABLE+ statement to define the data's layout in
Hive. Importing data into Hive is as simple as adding the
*+\--hive-import+* option to your Sqoop command line.

If the Hive table already exists, you can specify the
*+\--hive-overwrite+* option to indicate that existing table in hive must
be replaced. After your data is imported into HDFS or this step is
omitted, Sqoop will generate a Hive script containing a +CREATE TABLE+
operation defining your columns using Hive's types, and a +LOAD DATA INPATH+
statement to move the data files into Hive's warehouse directory.

The script will be executed by calling
the installed copy of hive on the machine where Sqoop is run. If you have
multiple Hive installations, or +hive+ is not in your +$PATH+, use the
*+\--hive-home+* option to identify the Hive installation directory.
Sqoop will use +$HIVE_HOME/bin/hive+ from here.

NOTE: This function is incompatible with +\--as-sequencefile+.

Hive's text parser does not support escaping or enclosing
characters. Sqoop will print a warning if you use +\--escaped-by+,
+\--enclosed-by+, or +\--optionally-enclosed-by+ because Hive does not know
how to parse these. It will pass the field and record delimiters through
to Hive. If you do not set any delimiters and do use +\--hive-import+,
the field delimiter will be set to +^A+ and the record delimiter will
be set to +\n+ to be consistent with Hive's defaults. It is important when
importing data to Hive to choose unambiguous field and record delimiters
due to the lack of escape and enclosing characters.

The table name used in Hive is, by default, the same as that of the
source table. You can control the output table name with the +\--hive-table+
option.
